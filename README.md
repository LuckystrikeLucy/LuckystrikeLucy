LuckystrikeLucy is a game developer who began life in London, graduated from art school, lucked out with jobs in some top video game companies (as well as some utterly random ones) then ran around the world for a bit before settling back home in London. Raised mainly on MS-DOS, Game Boy, SNES, N64 and a vast array of PC games, she started out as a producer for Supermono Studios before sliding into a unique position at Media Molecule to work on their triple BAFTA winner, Tearaway.
